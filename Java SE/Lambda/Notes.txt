The body of a lambda expression can contain zero, one,
 or more statements.


When there is a single statement curly brackets are not mandatory and 
the return type of the anonymous function is the same as that of the body expression.


When there is more than one statement, 
then these must be enclosed in curly brackets (a code block) and 
the return type of the anonymous function is the same as 
the type of the value returned within the code block, or void if nothing is returned.
